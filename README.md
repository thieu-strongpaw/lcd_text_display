# Pico LCD Message Display
This project is intended to us a Raspberry Pi Pico W to control a LCD 1602 display. It will be controlled through a web browser. 

I have two main goals to accomplish:
1. Gain a beginner understanding of how software interacts with hardware. 
2. Start using git.

I'll use the I2C standard to communicate between the LCD screen and the Pi and the picozero package to control the Pi. 
As of writing this, have very little idea what git is past saying it is version control software. I think starting my first posted project is a great way to learn. 
I will consider these goals successful if I can understand how Python creates objects that control physical devices and, in my own words, explain what version control is and 
how to use its most basic functions.
